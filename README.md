# Money 20/20 Hackathon Entry - VISA ID

In 24 hours myself and two backend developers created an application allowing for peer-to-peer identity verification utilizing VISA APIs.
I was responsible for the following:
- Frontend environment setup (Webpack, babel, eslint, react/redux)
- All frontend development
- Data retrieval from the backend
- All styling
